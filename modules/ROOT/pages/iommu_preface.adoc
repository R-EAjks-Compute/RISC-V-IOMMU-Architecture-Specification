The following backward-compatible changes--comprising a set of clarifications
and corrections--have been made since version 20240901:

* Typographic errors have been corrected, and editorial updates have been made.
* Clarified that the translation size is implementation-defined when both
  stages are bare.
* Clarified that the size of a queue is one less than the number of its entries.

These changes were made through PR#441, cite:[PR441].

[.big]*_Preface to Version 20240901_*

Chapters 2 through 8 of this document form the RISC-V IOMMU Base Architecture
Specification. Chapter 9 includes the standard extensions to the base
architecture. This release, version 20240901, contains the following versions
of the RISC-V IOMMU Base Architecture specification and standard extensions:

The following backward-compatible changes, comprising a set of clarifications
and corrections, have been made since version 1.0.0:

* A set of typographic errors and editorial updates were made.
* Translations cached, if any, in `Bare` mode do not require invalidation.
* Clarified that memory faults encountered by commands also set the `cqmf` flag.
* Values tested by algorithms in SW Guidelines are before modifications made by
  the algorithms.
* Included SW guidelines for modifying non-leaf PDT entries.
* Clarified the behavior for in-flight transactions observed at the time of `ddtp`
  write operations.
* Clarified the behavior when `IOTINVAL` is invoked with an invalid address.
* Stated that faults leading to UR/CA ATS responses are reported in the Fault Queue.
* Added a detailed description of the `capabilities.PAS` field.
* SW guidelines for changing IOMMU modes and programming `tr_req_ctl` and HPM
  counters.
* PCIe ATS Translation Resp. grants execute permission only if requested.
* Clarified the handling of hardware implementations that internally split
  8-byte transactions.
* Shadow stack encodings introduced by Zicfiss are reserved for IOMMU use.
* Listed the fault codes reported for faults detected by Page Request.
* Updated Fig 31 to remove the unused Destination ID field for ATS.PRGR
* Included a software guideline for IOMMU emulation.

These changes were made through PR#243 cite:[PR243].
