[[QOSID]]
=== Quality-of-Service (QoS) Identifiers Extension, Version 1.0

Quality of Service (QoS) is defined as the minimal end-to-end performance
guaranteed in advance by a service level agreement (SLA) to a workload.
Performance metrics might include measures such as instructions per cycle (IPC),
latency of service, etc.

When multiple workloads execute concurrently on modern processors -- equipped
with large core counts, multiple cache hierarchies, and multiple memory
controllers -- the performance of any given workload becomes less
deterministic, or even non-deterministic, due to shared resource contention
cite:[PTCAMP].

To manage performance variability, system software needs resource allocation
and monitoring capabilities. These capabilities allow for the reservation of
resources like cache and bandwidth, thus meeting individual performance targets
while minimizing interference cite:[HERACLES]. For resource management, hardware
should provide monitoring features that allow system software to profile
workload resource consumption and allocate resources accordingly.

To facilitate this, the QoS Identifiers ISA extension (Ssqosid) cite:[SSQOSID]
introduces the `srmcfg` register, which configures a hart with two identifiers:
a Resource Control ID (`RCID`) and a Monitoring Counter ID (`MCID`). These
identifiers accompany each request issued by the hart to shared resource
controllers.

These identifiers are crucial for the RISC-V Capacity and Bandwidth Controller
QoS Register Interface cite:[CBQRI], which provides methods for setting resource
usage limits and monitoring resource consumption. The `RCID` controls resource
allocations, while the `MCID` is used for tracking resource usage.

The IOMMU QoS ID extension provides a method to associate QoS IDs with requests
to access resources by the IOMMU, as well as with devices governed by it. This
complements the Ssqosid extension that provides a method to associate QoS IDs
with requests originated by the RISC-V harts. Assocating QoS IDs with device
and IOMMU originated requests is required for effective monitoring and
allocation of shared resources.

The IOMMU `capabilities` register (<<CAP>>) is extended with a `QOSID` field
which enumerates support for associating QoS IDs with requests made through the
IOMMU. When `capabilities.QOSID` is 1, the memory-mapped register layout is
extended to add a register named `iommu_qosid` (<<IOQOSID>>). This register is
used to configure the Quality of Service (QoS) IDs associated with
IOMMU-originated requests. The `ta` field of the device context (<<DC_TA>>) is
extended with two fields, `RCID` and `MCID`, to configure the QoS IDs to
associate with requests originated by the devices.

==== Reset Behavior

If the reset value for `ddtp.iommu_mode` field is `Bare`, then the
`iommu_qosid.RCID` field must have a reset value of 0.

[NOTE]
====
At reset, it is required that the `RCID` field of `iommu_qosid` is set to 0 if
the IOMMU is in `Bare` mode, as typically the resource controllers in the
SoC default to a reset behavior of associating all capacity or bandwidth to the
`RCID` value of 0. When the reset value of the `ddtp.iommu_mode` is not `Bare`,
the `iommu_qosid` register should be initialized by software before changing
the mode to allow DMA.
====

==== Sizing QoS Identifiers

The size (or width) of `RCID` and `MCID`, as fields in registers or in data
structures, supported by the IOMMU must be at least as large as that supported
by any RISC-V application processor hart in the system.

==== IOMMU ATC Capacity Allocation and Monitoring

Some IOMMUs might support capacity allocation and usage monitoring in the IOMMU
address translation cache (IOATC) by implementing the capacity controller
register interface.

Additionally, some IOMMUs might support multiple IOATCs, each potentially having
different capacities. In scenarios where multiple IOATCs are implemented, such
as an IOATC for each supported page size, the IOMMU can implement a capacity
controller register interface for each IOATC to facilitate individual capacity
allocation.

[[NLINV]]
=== Non-leaf PTE Invalidation Extension, Version 1.0

The RISC-V IOMMU Version 1.0 specification provides commands to invalidate
leaf page table entries from address translation caches when performing an
address-specific invalidation operation. The non-leaf PTE invalidation
extension provides commands to optionally also invalidate non-leaf PTE
entries from the address translation caches when performing an
address-specific invalidation operation.

The non-leaf PTE invalidation extension is implemented if the `capabilities.NL`
(bit 42) is 1. When the `capabilities.NL` bit is 1, a non-leaf (`NL`) field is
defined at bit 34 in the `IOTINVAL.VMA` and `IOTINVAL.GVMA` commands by this
extension. When the `capabilities.NL` bit is 0, bit 34 remains reserved.

[NOTE]
====
The non-leaf PTE invalidation extension enables optimizations in shared
virtual addressing use cases by providing the ability to invalidate non-leaf
PTEs corresponding to the IOVA being invalidated from the IOMMU address
translation caches.
====

If the address range invalidation extension is also implemented, the `NL`
operand applies to the address range determined by the `ADDR` and `S` operands.

==== Non-leaf PTE Invalidation by `IOTINVAL.VMA`

* When the `AV` operand is 0, the `NL` operand is ignored and the `IOTINVAL.VMA`
  command operations are as specified in RISC-V IOMMU Version 1.0 specification.

* When the `AV` operand is 1 and the `NL` operand is 0, the `IOTINVAL.VMA`
  command operations are as specified in RISC-V IOMMU Version 1.0 specification.

* When both the `AV` and `NL` operands are 1, the `IOTINVAL.VMA` command
  performs the following operations:

** When `GV=0` and `PSCV=0`: Invalidates information cached from all levels of
   first-stage page table entries corresponding to the IOVA in the `ADDR`
   operand for all host address spaces, including entries containing global
   mappings.

** When `GV=0` and `PSCV=1`: Invalidates information cached from all levels of
   first-stage page table entries corresponding to the IOVA in the `ADDR`
   operand and the host address space identified by the `PSCID` operand, except
   for entries containing global mappings.

** When `GV=1` and `PSCV=0`: Invalidates information cached from all levels of
   first-stage page table entries corresponding to the IOVA in the `ADDR`
   operand for all VM address spaces associated with the `GSCID` operand,
   including entries that contain global mappings.

** When `GV=1` and `PSCV=1`: Invalidates information cached from all levels of
   first-stage page table entries corresponding to the IOVA in the `ADDR`
   operand and the VM address space identified by the `PSCID` and `GSCID`
   operands, except for entries containing global mappings.

==== Non-leaf PTE Invalidation by `IOTINVAL.GVMA`

* When the `GV` operand is 0, both the `AV` and `NL` operands are ignored and
  the `IOTINVAL.GVMA` command operations are as specified in RISC-V IOMMU
  Version 1.0 specification.

* When the `GV` operand is 1 and the `AV` operand is 0, the `NL` operand is
  ignored and the `IOTINVAL.GVMA` command operations are as specified in
  RISC-V IOMMU Version 1.0 specification.

* When the `GV` and `AV` operands are 1 and the `NL` operand is 0, the
  `IOTINVAL.GVMA` command operations are as specified in RISC-V IOMMU Version
  1.0 specification.

* When `GV`, `AV`, and `NL` are all 1, the `IOTINVAL.GVMA` command performs the
  following operations:

** Invalidates information cached from all levels of second-stage page table
   entries corresponding to the guest-physical address in the `ADDR` operand and
   the VM address spaces identified by the `GSCID` operand.

[[ARINV]]
=== Address Range Invalidation Extension, Version 1.0

The address range invalidation extension enables specifying a range of addresses
in an IOMMU ATC invalidation command, reducing the number of commands queued to
the IOMMU. This facility is especially useful when superpages are employed in
page tables.

The address range invalidation extension is implemented if `capabilities.S` (bit
43) is 1. When `capabilities.S` is 1, a range-size (`S`) operand is defined at
bit 73 in the `IOTINVAL.VMA` and `IOTINVAL.GVMA` commands by this extension.
When the `capabilities.S` bit is 0, bit 73 remains reserved.

When the `GV` operand is 0, both the `AV` and `S` operands are ignored by the
`IOTINVAL.GVMA` command. When the `AV` operand is 0, the `S` operand is ignored
in both the `IOTINVAL.VMA` and `IOTINVAL.GVMA` commands. When the `S` operand is
ignored or set to 0, the operations of the `IOTINVAL.VMA` and `IOTINVAL.GVMA`
commands are as specified in the RISC-V IOMMU Version 1.0 specification.

When the `S` operand is not ignored and is 1, the `ADDR` operand represents a
NAPOT range encoded in the operand itself. Starting from bit position 0
of the `ADDR` operand, if the first 0 bit is at position `X`, the range size is
`2^(X+1)^ * 4` KiB. When `X` is 0, the size of the range is 8 KiB.

If the `S` operand is not ignored and is 1 and all bits of the `ADDR` operand
are 1, the behavior is UNSPECIFIED.

If the `S` operand is not ignored and is 1 and the most significant bit of the
`ADDR` operand is 0 while all other bits are 1, the specified address range
covers the entire address space.

[NOTE]
====
The NAPOT range encoding used by this extension follows the convention used by
PCIe ATS Invalidation Requests to denote address ranges. This convention is also
used to encode the translation range size in `tr_response` (<<TRR_RSP>>)
register.

Simpler implementations may invalidate all address-translation cache entries
when the `S` bit is set to 1.
